# FinancialApp

## Project description
The project was created in order to test and improve my knowledge in java programming and related technologies.
FinancialApp is a file processing application that currently can process a single type of file, but it was implemented in such way that it is possible to easily add different types of files to be processed. The result of the processing can be written to a file or to a database.

## Future planned improvements
- implement a new processor for a different type of file

## Used technologies
- JDK 1.8
- Apache Maven 3.5.0
- JUnit 4.12
- Log4j 1.2.17
- MySQL
